# Name
Timesaur

# Genre
Platform Game

# Synopsis
It's inspired off of the Dino game bundled into Chrome, where you jump over obstacles (spikes in this demo).

If you fail to jump over them in time, then you die and respawn. The global timer also increases drastically as you progress in the game.

# Core Features
- Jumping over small obstacles
- Constantly increasing movement speed which makes the game more challenging, and it pushes you to predict when and when not to jump
- A highscore metre so you can always try and beat your own score

# Systems
1. Jumping
2. Dying
3. Highscore
4. Speed increase

# Graphics
Just gray/white graphics to cut down on eye-strain and just keep it simple for a first.

# Scope
It'll probably be a relatively easy game to make, but I'm not sure as I'm mainly used to Unity and haven't done anything in GM Studio before.

If it's done earlier than expected and I got loads of time left, then I'll add more obstacles, possibly improve the graphics, and maybe add some smaller special abilities which are available at random.
